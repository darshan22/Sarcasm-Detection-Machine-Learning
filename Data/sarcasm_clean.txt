Before I graduate high school I will joy ride the security's golf cart
Before I workout, I like to warm up with 10 sets of selfie's.
Before people get to know me : Oh my god you're so shy.. and quiet... it's adorable. After we become friends : DEAR GOD DO YOU EVER SHUT UP?
Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you only dress yourself. Moral of the story : No one helps you once you're fucked.
Before someone gets their drivers license they should have to beat rainbow road on io Kart without falling off.
Before the internet, we did things and thought things and ate things and had no way of letting strangers know what they were. It was brutal.

Before you begin a serious relationship make sure you agree on the import stuff like children, marriage and levels of pulp in orange juice.
Before you decide to spend less time on social media, make sure you go to every social media website and tell everyone.
Before you get married, ask yourself ; Is this the person you want to watch stare at their phone the rest of your life?
Before you marry a person you should first make them use a computer with slow internet to see who they really are.
Before you open your mouth, make sure you have a mind to back up all the things you say.
Be happy in front of people who don't like you, it kills them. This is what @bernardokath meant to her motto " Kill them with Kindness. " 😊 😊 😊
Behind every chick who says she has a " stalker " is actually just a normal dude who is responding to her slutty texts.
Behind every great woman, there is a guy looking at her ass.

Be wary of someone who calls all their exes crazy. They're probably the reason.

Facebook, are you that insecure in that you always need to know what's on my mind?
Facebook asks : What's on your mind? Twitter asks : What's happening? Instagram asks : What did you eat? The Web is a worried mom.
Facebook can read what you're typing, even when you don't post it. #Creepy
Facebook is a lot like jail. You sit around and write on walls and get poked by random people.
Facebook is for people I normally see. Twitter is for people I wish I could see.
Facebook is just like my refrigerator. I check it every 10 minutes and yet there's nothing new.
Facebook is like a fridge. When you're bored you keep opening and closing it every few minutes to see if there's anything good in it.
Facebook is like a relationship : Faithful on your wall, but cheating in their inbox
Facebook is like jail, you sit around and waste time, write on walls, and get poked by people you don't know.
Facebook is only good for reminding me how much I hate birthdays, births, faces, discussions, interactions and events

Facebook is the only place where it's acceptable to talk to a wall.
Facebook keeps changing, updating... yet they can't add a simple " " dislike " " button -_-
Facebook makes me want to puke.
Facebook needs a " Wow, that's the dumbest fucking thing I've heard, you should be punched in the throat " button.
Facebook needs to add " still banging my ex " as a relationship status option.
Facebook people be like " Like this if you love waffles. Ignore if you have buttsex with Satan. " wtf is happing?!
Facebook rule #1: If I'm not in it, don't tag me in your photo.
Facebook should have a Limit on times u can Change ur Relationship Status in a Year! After 2 it should default to ' " Unstable " '
Facebook should just change it's name to " People You May Want to Avoid. "
Facebook should limit the amount of times you can change your relationship status. After 3 times it should say " Unstable. "
Facebook should make it to where it says, 'Went from being in a relationship ' to 'Problem solved. '

Finding someone who thinks ur interesting enough to talk to u every day, whether theyre a friend or a lover, is one of the best feelings ever
Finding that out made me SO happy
Find someone who is honest, laughs when you make fun of them, and then give each other orgasms.
Find someone who makes you happy and hold them responsible for all your emotions.
find someone who will be there for you at 2 am when you're falling apart, but also at 3 pm when you love life and they make you love it more
Find someone who will change your life, not just your status.

Friday Night Drags have been canceled due to technical difficulties. We don't have a rescheduled date soon! Thanks for understanding!
Fridays ' classes are the most boring ones, but what's best about them is that they only last from 9 to 12 am :^)
Friday the 13th... Who needs Friday the 13th when you have bad luck naturally
*Friend comes over* Friend : " Do you have a bathroom? " Me : " No, we shit outside. "
Friend : " Dude I wasn't THAT drunk... " Me : " Dude, you gave a mushroom to a midget and kept yelling 'GROW MARIO GROW.
friend : how are things me : please don't make me think about my life
friendly reminder :27 more days until Christmas, you can do it 🎅🎄🎁
Friendly reminder that Adele and Taylor Swift are the same age yet one of them has a child and another is mentally stuck in middle school.
Friend : " Omg, your parents are so nice! " You : " It's because you're here.. "
Friends are like boobs. Some are big, some are small. Some are real and some are fake.
friends are supposed to make you feel good about yourself just remember that
Friends buy you food. Best friends eat your food.
Friendship is like a book, it takes a few seconds to burn, but it takes years to write
friendship is not about who you spend the most time with, it's about who you have the best time with & who's actually there for you
Friendship isn't about who you've known the longest. It's about who walked into your life, said " I'm here for you " and proved it.
Friendship is so weird... you just pick a human you've met and you're like " yup I like this one " and you just do stuff with them.
Friends knock on your door. Best friends walk into your house and start eating.
Friends who buy you food are friends for life.
friends who dont take random pictures of me when were together : do u not care about my instagrams aesthetic?
Friend : there's a life outside the internet. Me : send me the link.
friend : whats your favorite season? me : of which show? friend : me : friend : me : me : me : oh you meant like the weather
Friend : Would you roam around naked if you were Invisible Me : What's the point of being naked then.. F : :-/ tweet
Friend : " Your zipper is down. " Me : " Ughh, your mom is so forgetful! "
Friend : you should've come with us! Me : an invite would of helped

Google : " I have everything! " Facebook : " I know everybody! " Internet : " Without me, you're all nothing. " Electricity : " Keep talking, bitches. "
Google image results are like a party that starts off exactly how you expected and gets weirder the longer you stay.
Google + is the gym of social networking : We all join, but nobody actually uses it.
Googling your symptoms when you don't feel well is the most efficient way to convince yourself you're dying.

It takes about 2. 9 seconds for me to go from " this is the best day ever " to " I want to stab every human being on planet Earth ".
It takes me like three days to wake up in the morning.
It takes men a long time to text back because we know it's going to be scrutinized like a document that was smuggled out of Microsoft office
It takes more muscles to frown than to smile. I've learned to hate fun because I want a super buff face.
It takes so much self control for me not to write, " you sure about that? " under Facebook engagement announcements.

ladies : be careful if you wear spaghetti straps. It distracts boys bc they'll think about pasta. They'll stop at nothing to get pasta.
LADIES... ever saw a guy that was cute, yall started talking & things were good but turned bad the more he spewed dumb shit out his mouth?
Ladies, if you think your man is cheating. Take him to that bitch's front door and see if his wifi connects.
Ladies, it's not fair to hide your crazy behind a great pair of boobs. It's impossible for men to see past them.
Ladies... when I say bless you after a sneeze, just say Thank you, instead of wondering where in the bushes that just came from!
Ladies why does it nearly always choose to rain heavy when we're out and just done our hair and make up? 😩

Letting someone in your life is like turning off the antivirus, downloading a file from the internet, installing it & hope it's not a virus.
Letting your barely 13 year old drive a dually and a trailer, (obviously without a license ) just small town thingzzzzz
LET UR OLD " FRIENDS " GO IF THEY ARENT HELPING YOU GROW OR NOT SUPPORTING YOU. YOU DONT NEED PEOPLE WHO ENVY YOU

Life Hack : Die to get out of your student loan debt.
LIFE HACK : Don't cut all your nails. Keep one for emergency when you have no toothpicks
life hack : kill everyone except ur crush so they're forced to date u
Life hack : You can park wherever you want if you put your hazard lights on and take your tire off.

Life is too short to wake up with regrets, so love the people who treat you right, and forget the ones who don't.
Life is tough when you're a lazy perfectionist who doesn't give a shit about anything but at the same time cares too much about everything.
Life is uncertain which is why every morning, before I leave for work, I hug my kids and whisper " avenge me.. "
Life is weird. First you wanna grow up, then you wanna be a kid again.
Life is weird. You can go from being strangers. To being friends. To being more than friends. To being pratically strangers again.
Life is wonderful #not
life's too short to not be straight up about how you feel
Life's too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So, love the people who treat you right and forget about the ones who don't.

marriage is kinda weird though because it's like ‘i love you, lets get the law involved so you can't leave "
Marriage is like a public toilet. Those waiting outside are desperate to get in. Those inside are desperate to get out
Marriage is like the IKEA of relationships. Easy to walk into, confusing to piece together and difficult to exit.
Marriage is not always the answer lol #not -for -everyone
Marriage is something you should pay for and divorce should be free. You might think twice before buying into it.
Marriage teaches you forgiveness, compromise and tons of other things you wouldn't need if you'd stayed single
marry someone who has a different favorite cereal than u so they wont eat all of urs

Men also have feelings for example... they can feel hungry.
Men and women can absolutely just be friends. After they make out to get that curiosity out of their system.
Men are born between a woman's legs and spend the rest of their lives trying to get back in them. Why? Because there's no place like home.
Men are like bras. Some are sexy & fun. Some are very supportive. Others are annoying as hell and you can't wait to get rid of them every day
Men do you want to know what's going on in a woman's mind? Imagine 3, 587 tabs open at the same time. All the time.
@M_endri hahah that is such a funny joke oh man u kill me #Not #fku #poussy

Relationships are like batteries, they have a positive & a negative side. And you end up whacking your remote instead of changing them.
Relationships are like garage sales : from a distance it looks like something interesting but up close it's just a lot of shit you don't need
Relationships are like garage sales. From a distance they look interesting but up close it's just a bunch of crap you don't need.
Relationships include : fight jeaousy arguments faith tears disagreements. But REAL relationships fight through all that with love. :)
Relationships should come with an icon that shows you how much time you have left like your phone's battery.
Relationship status : Can't wait for Monday so that I start working again
Relationship status : Nowhere near as happy as those couples from the erectile dysfunction commercials.
Relationship status : Putting aloe on the wall and rubbing against it to apply in places that I can't reach.
Religion is like a buffet. People take what they like and ignore the rest.

sleep is a freaking chore. I hate sleeping.
Sleep is for the people who has no access to Internet.
Sleep is like sex, I don't get either one as much as I want
Sleep is like sex, you never get enough of it and sometimes it feels like it never happened at all.
Sleep is my drug. My bed is my dealer. My alarm is the cops. School is the jail.
Sleep is so cute when it tries to compete with the internet.
Sleep is so great. But also awful. Like I could do so much in the time I sleep, but doing nothing and sleeping is glorious. Damn you sleep
Sleepover Fact : The later it becomes, the more truth comes out.
Sleep + social life = bad grades. Good grades + sleep = no social life. Good grades + social life = no sleep.

Smoking a cigarette causes damage in minutes - not years.
Smoking can cause your nipples to fall off.
Smoking marijuana does not define you man. I don't understand why some people think you can't be your own person and enjoy smoking weed.
Smoking weed is illegal... but then again, so is most of the music on your iPod.

Teach your kids about taxes and social security by taking 30% of their Halloween candy and promising to give part of it back in 70 years.
Tears of joy gone be pouring down my face when I leave school 😭 😆
technically I agree. They usually don't get caught. Criminals find people who want their money - plenty of inventory.
Technology is outpacing my ability to come up with convincing lies that I didn't get your message.

Teenagers have time + energy but no money. Middle age people have money + energy but no time. Old people have time + money but no energy.
teenagers : I lost my virginity at a party. me : I lost a follower while I was sleeping.
Teenagers : The most misunderstood people on earth. Treated like children and expected to act like adults.
Teenage years are the best years of your life "... I sure as fuck hope not.
@Teenie__ continue hoping for yalls struggle to end. Keep faith cuz that shit never gonna happen it seems 😐
teen pregnancy is more acceptable than being gay and that's really sad
Teen pregnancy will be at a all time low due to the releasing of Black Ops 2 & Halo 4.

@Tehelka Wow a CONVICTED Scamsters frustration is coming out
@Telegraph Sure. Feels that it's normal talk for men to talk about molesting women. With his finger on the pulse he'll fit in nicely.
tell a girl she has an attitude & watch her catch an attitude about how she doesn't have one
Tell a man there are 400 billion stars and hell believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint and he needs to touch it.
Telling a girl to calm down is like trying to baptize a fucking cat.
Telling a girl to calm down works about as well as trying to baptize a cat.
Telling people to follow me while threatening them. That's a nice approach.
Telling someone not to be sad because others have it worse, is like telling people they can't be happy because others have it better.
Telling the cop that you thought the voice in your GPS counted as a designated driver doesn't help your case.
tell me I'm cute or something so I can like roll my eyes at you but then blush when I think about it later
Ten years to wait oh boy! Well nine as this year draws to a close!

Textaphrenia. A disease found in teens, in which they have heard or felt a new text message vibration when there is no message.
*Texting a new person *Them : send me a picture Me : bitch this ain't Snapchat!
Texting is cool. You sound polite to the receiver but nobody knows that you are typing with your middle finger.
texting one person consistently 24/7 is so much better than having multiple people in your phone
texting someone who doesn't use emoticons is like being locked in a room alone with kristen stewart.
Texting wasn't always easy. In my day, you had to work for it. You had to want it. You need an S? You better click that 7 button FOUR TIMES
Text me first + Fast replies = Perfect person to text.
Text me when you're bored and I'll ignore it like I'm busy.

Women are like police, they can have all the evidence in the world but they still want a confession.
Women are naturally better liars than men, and they’re also better at detecting lies.
Women are simple. With them, yes means yes and no means yes and no means no and no means maybe but maybe means yes and maybe means no
Women can walk around all day long in a bikini, but God forbid if you see them in their bras and panties. I will never comprehend this.
Women don't poop, they hold it in and it comes out as drama.
Women might be able to fake orgasms. But men can fake a whole relationship
Women remember criticism like an elephant but compliments like a goldfish.
Women's logic : I went to buy a dress. But I saw a beautiful pair of shoes. So I bought this handbag.
Women's logic : When you like a guy, do nothing about it and expect him to magically know and make the first move.
Women wake up yawning while men wake up with an erection. Coincidence? I think NOT.
Women : when it comes to doggy style, men are behind you 100%
Women who pretend to like football are the same women who pretend to be on birth control.
Wonder how much farther I have to walk before these corduroy pants finally catch on fire.
